  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm Tuna Ozkalkanli, a Computer Science student at Université de Caen from Türkiye, currently in my final year. I enjoy working on functional programming, efficient algorithms, and sometimes minimal websites like this one.</p>
  <p>I got interested in low-level systems and OS internals after taking <i>Programmation système en C</i> in my third semester. I’m still just getting started, but it’s the kind of work I’d love to go deeper into.</p>
  <p>Outside of school, I spend my off-hours with a guitar, some headphones, and no real plans.</p>
